# **Portfolio**
This repo aims to showcase projects I will do throughout the course. The projects will be made as part of the Manchester Codes 24-week Software Engineer FastTrack course. I am part of its September 2019 cohort.

This is my attempt to re-work my personal website that I made using WordPress. I used this CMS for 2 main reasons: (1) it was easy, and (2) I thought I wanted to start a blog (then realised I just want to show my work, not to talk about the rest of my life. This project will be a sort of challenge that I set myself to do: to do a portfolio site like the one I did using the familiar and not-so-familiar technologies I am about to encounter in this course.

This was the website I made -- <https://joannebasa.com/>
