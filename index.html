                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <aside><quote>I live to help people, and work on projects that impact their day-to-day lives for the better.</br>
                    THIS IS WHAT DRIVES ME.</quote></aside>
                <p>My journey to web development was a curious one. I have been an intensive care nurse but have always wondered how websites work, and always held that dream (and curiosity) to be a web developer. 
                After overcoming several roadblocks, I was finally able to study full-stack web development and I worked as a junior web developer for a healthcare digital agency in Bristol. 
                I came to see how creating healthcare-specific web applications can help people in a different way--- and <i>I absolutely loved it.</i>
                I also believe web technologies are the future: it will be one that can reach out to every industry, therefore reach out to potentially every single person. With the right approach to modern web technology, this can bring about a good change in everybody's lives.</br>
                <strong><u>I want to be a part of that revolution.</u></strong></br>
                After getting through yet another (health) hurdle, I am more than determined to go back to web development. I now live in Manchester, and when I am not coding (or doing a nursing shift), I am busy cycling and playing the guitar. I am also a very proud mum of a 4 year old boy.
                I am open for collaboration on open-source and other projects, and would definitely be interested  in further learning and development opportunities.</p>
